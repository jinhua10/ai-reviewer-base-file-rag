  prompt:
    # Concise prompt: extract key information, avoid redundancy
    extract_text_concise: |
      Please analyze this image and extract **key information**, requiring conciseness without omitting important content:

      1. **Image Theme**: Summarize the core content and purpose of the image in one sentence

      2. **Core Text**: Extract all important text content
         - Titles, main labels, key annotations
         - Important data/values/parameters
         - Core conclusions or key points

      3. **Key Structural Information** (based on image type, only retain core content):
         【Architecture/System Diagram】:
         - All component/module names
         - Connection relationships and data flow between components
         - Tech stack, protocols (if any)

         【Flowchart】: Key steps and branching logic

         【Chart/Statistics】: Core data points, trend conclusions

         【Table】: Headers and key data

         【Others】: Main content elements

      **Output Requirements**:
      - Concise and to the point, without redundant descriptions or subjective evaluations
      - But must retain all key information, without omitting important content
      - For complex images like architecture diagrams, completely preserve component and relationship information

    # Detailed prompt: full analysis
    extract_text: |
      Please comprehensively analyze this image and output according to the following structure:
      
      1. **Image Overview**: Summarize the main content, type, and purpose of the image in 1-2 sentences
      
      2. **Text Content**: Completely extract all text in the image
         - Titles, labels, annotations
         - Component names, module names
         - Descriptive text, legends
         - Maintain hierarchical and positional relationships of text
      
      3. **Structured Information** (detailed description based on image type):
      
         【Architecture/System Diagram】:
         - List all components/modules/nodes and their names
         - Explain connection relationships between components (who connects to whom, connection direction)
         - Describe data flow or information flow direction
         - Explain hierarchical relationships of components (frontend, backend, database, etc.)
         - Label tech stack, protocols, ports, etc.
      
         【Flowchart】:
         - List all process steps in order
         - Explain conditional branches and judgment logic
         - Label start and end points
      
         【Charts/Statistics】:
         - Chart type (bar/line/pie chart, etc.)
         - Axis meaning and units
         - Specific data points and values
         - Data trends and key findings
      
         【Tables】:
         - Header information
         - Extract data by rows and columns completely
         - Maintain table structure relationships
      
         【Screenshots/Interface】:
         - Interface type and function
         - Main functional modules
         - Menu, buttons and other interactive elements
      
         【Other Images】:
         - Describe main content and composition
         - Key visual elements
      
      4. **Key Information Extraction**:
         - Core technical points
         - Important data or parameters
         - Key conclusions or points
         - Information that needs special attention
      
      Output Requirements:
      - Information must be complete, accurate, and structured
      - For architecture diagrams, must detail connection relationships between components
      - Technical terms, numbers, formulas must be accurately identified
      - Use clear hierarchical structure to organize content
      - Do not add subjective evaluations, only state objective information
